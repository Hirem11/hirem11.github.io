          <h1>Hirem11's Semi-Temporary GitHub Page</h1>
          <br>
          <p>Welcome! If you're wondering why exactly this looks so god awful, there are two simple reasons.</p>
          <br>
          <h1>Reason Number One:</h1>
          <p>Minimalism - you've probably got too many tabs open right now, at least this one isn't chugging that pathetic amount of ram you've got. You should feel ashamed. You should want to buy more expensive PC parts, hell maybe even a new computer you disgusting peasant. (/s for those with even less social skills than myself)</p>
          <br>
          <h1>Reason Number Two (The real reason): </h1>
          <p>Okay okay I put this together in five minutes as a break from my actual projects, that whole minimalism thing I stand for, but it was just an excuse. Who'd have guessed it?</p>
          <br>
          <p>I'm also pretty terrible at html/css, but hey I like old terminal styling so doesn't bother me too much!</p>
          <p>In the meantime, here is a royalty free picture of a monkey I found on Google.</p>
